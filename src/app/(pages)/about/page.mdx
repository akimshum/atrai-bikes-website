# About Atrai bikes

### Summary
Despite ongoing discussions, motorized individual transportation continues to dominate globally, leading to challenges such as high land use, CO2 emissions, and traffic accidents. This poses a significant problem affecting citizens' quality of life, causing various land-use conflicts. Achieving sustainable transportation, crucial for meeting SDGs, is particularly challenging for cities with a high number of commuters where public transportation is limited. The desire for bike-friendly and safe infrastructure arises, but how can municipalities efficiently improve bike infrastructure based on real data?

Our project aims to motivate and support individuals, businesses, and local governments, especially in São Paulo (Brazil) and Münster (Germany), to collect and analyze individualized data on bike infrastructure. The gathered information will contribute to decision-making for urban infrastructure improvement, involving citizens and businesses in political decisions for safer and bike-friendly cities based on Open Data and Citizen Science principles.

### Technical Foundation
We utilize the senseBox (www.sensebox.de), a modular environmental measurement kit developed at the University of Münster. Tailored for attachment to bikes, citizens using the senseBox:bike can collect data on parameters like distance to vehicular traffic, bike path quality, and potential hazards during daily commutes. Additionally, environmental factors such as temperature and particulate matter can be measured. Workshops support citizens in building and programming these devices, enhancing motivation and data literacy.

The collected data is stored and initially visualized using the existing openSenseMap solution. We expand this with a web-based analysis component as a standalone software, incorporating analytical GeoAI tools developed throughout the project. This tool creates data-driven reports for various stakeholders and regions, supporting bike system implementation and improvement in urban environments, starting with Münster and São Paulo.

### Project Significance
Focusing on two contrasting cities, Münster and São Paulo, enhances cultural and political understanding throughout the project. This strengthens collaboration between German and Brazilian project partners, promoting concepts like Open Data and Citizen Science among the general population.

Project goals align with funding policy objectives, emphasizing citizen involvement in urban development through data-driven innovations, particularly in the Transport & Traffic sector within Smart Cities. International Citizen Science fosters future competencies such as Data Literacy and Green Competencies, emphasizing sustainable urban planning.

### Scientific and Technical Objectives
The project aims to develop and test methods for capturing relevant bike-related data (environmental, vehicle distances, bike path quality) for a data-driven transportation shift. A collaborative development approach involves software users (cities/municipalities) and senseBox:bike hardware users (citizens), applying the Citizen Science approach. The project builds upon the senseBox developed by the University of Münster and re:edu, an education startup providing open-source software and resources.

The senseBox:bike, based on a programmable ESP32S2 microcontroller, integrates sensors for capturing data efficiently. Privacy measures ensure non-live transmission of collected data to the internet. The device, designed to be data-efficient and resource-friendly, measures bike path quality (via vibration and acceleration sensors) and cyclist safety through AI-based identification of overtaking maneuvers combined with object detection (Time of Flight Sensor). Environmental data like particulate matter (SPS30) and temperature (HDC1080) are also measured.

Cities, companies, or individuals interested in the hardware can use it for evaluating their bike infrastructure while publishing the data as Open Data. However, it's crucial to explain the product's context, open the digital world's black box for users, and educate them on handling the data. Collaboration with 52°North from Münster and Instituto Cordial from São Paulo facilitates data analysis (e.g., GeoAI), visualization, and data publication, enhancing the project with web-based software and workshop concepts involving various stakeholders.
