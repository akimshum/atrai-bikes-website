# Project

The Atrai Bikes Project stands as a pioneering research initiative aimed at transforming urban planning by involving citizens, companies, and local governments in the systematic collection and analysis of bicycle infrastructure data. This two-year endeavor, funded by the Ministry of Economy of Germany and Fapesp in Brazil, is a collaborative effort between three organizations: re:edu and 52°North in Münster/Germany, and the Cordial Institute in São Paulo/Brazil. Set to commence in January 2024, the project seeks to spark innovative urban cycling solutions.

Central to the project's objectives is the integration of hardware technology derived from the open-source senseBox:bike project, seamlessly connected to a dedicated app and web-based analysis platform. This infrastructure facilitates the effortless gathering of crucial data during cyclists' daily commutes and offers insights into parameters such as distance to car traffic, vibration levels, temperature fluctuations, and fine dust concentrations. These insights are invaluable to various stakeholders, providing a comprehensive understanding of the urban cycling experience.

The data collected is meticulously stored and visualized using the openSenseMap solution, an open data platform enriched with a web-based analysis component fortified with GeoAI tools. This technology empowers not only cyclists to make informed decisions about their routes but also enables companies to optimize logistics and governments to enhance bike lane infrastructure and understand cyclist flow.

Complementing this technological innovation is a robust citizen science approach. Workshops will be held in both Münster and São Paulo to engage participants, deepen their connection to the project, and strengthen their skills and motivation. This collaborative effort promises to not only enrich the user experience but also elevate the sophistication of software analysis processes, driving impactful advancements in urban cycling environments.

After two years of hardware and software development, research and multi-stakeholder engagement, Atrai bikes should significantly enhance urban cycling environments by increasing awareness, improving safety, enhancing infrastructure, and promoting sustainability.
