The Atrai Bikes Project is a two-year research initiative focused on transforming urban planning by engaging citizens, companies, and governments in the collection and analysis of bicycle infrastructure data. Funded by the BMBF in Germany and FAPESP in Brazil, the coopertation involves re:edu, 52°North, and the Cordial Institute, with the goal of driving innovation in urban cycling solutions. The project involves citizens in Germany and Brazil through workshops in Münster and São Paulo, fostering collaboration and deepening the project’s impact on urban cycling environments. 

The project integrates open-source senseBox:bike technology, connected to an app and web-based platform for collecting data during cyclists' daily commutes. Urban data such as proximity to car traffic, vibration levels, temperature, and fine dust concentrations are collected to offer valuable insights into the urban cycling experience for governments, companies and citizens.
