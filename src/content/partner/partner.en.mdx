The Reedu GmbH & Co. KG emerged from the BMBF-funded senseBox project. The company focuses on open sensor systems in the IoT market for the end user as well as for the education market. By simplifying and combining open source components, products (software and hardware) are created for citizens, students and schoolchildren that enable them to participate in problem-solving processes with social relevance (Citizen Science). The company’s competencies lie in early prototype development, the development of driver and accompanying software for the IoT products up to marketability as well as effective educational solutions and the organization of workshops and hackathons with different groups.
