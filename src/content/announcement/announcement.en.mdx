### With the senseBox:bike to the data-driven bicycle city

On October 30 from 5 to 8 p.m., a free workshop on the data-based design of the mobility transition with the senseBox:bike will take place at Venue X in Münster as part of our Atrai Bikes project. Citizens and all interested parties are cordially invited to get to know the senseBox:bike as an open-source sensor technology for the mobile collection of environmental and traffic data by bike and to try it out for themselves. In addition to recording and evaluating the measured traffic data, ideas and solutions will be developed together to improve the safety of cycle paths and the city's cycling infrastructure. No previous knowledge is required to take part!
