### With the senseBox:bike to the data-driven bicycle city

On October 30 from 5:00 to 8:00 pm, a free workshop on the data-based design of the mobility transition with the senseBox:bike will take place in Münster as part of our BMBF-funded Atrai Bikes project. Citizens and all interested parties are cordially invited to get to know the senseBox:bike as an open-source sensor technology for the mobile collection of environmental and traffic data by bike and to try it out for themselves. In addition to the innovative, AI-based recording and evaluation of the measured values relating to traffic and the environment, ideas and solutions will be developed together to improve the safety of cycle paths and the city's cycling infrastructure. Participants can then use a senseBox:bike to collect relevant data for possible improvements to the cycling infrastructure. No prior knowledge is required to participate!
