The hardware behind the Atrai bikes project builds upon the open-source technology known as the senseBox:bike, a significant upgrade from the established senseBox innovation. Developed collaboratively by the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of MÃ¼nster and re:edu, this device marks a notable advancement in mobile traffic data collection capabilities.The senseBox:bike is powered by the ESP32S2 microcontroller from Espressif and  delivers exceptional performance and versatility. With integrated WiFi functionality for seamless data transmission and an SD card slot for expanded storage options, it ensures both connectivity and flexibility in managing data, while also prioritizing user privacy by allowing control over data transmission via the companion app.

Equipped with a diverse array of sensors, the senseBox:bike captures a wide range of environmental data, cycling infrastructure details, and bike safety metrics. The HDC1080 sensor provides precise measurements of temperature and humidity, while the Sensirion SPS0 sensor offers insights into fine dust pollution across various particle sizes. Additionally, the MPU6050 vibration sensor and Beitan BN220 speed sensor enable the assessment of road surface quality. The inclusion of a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor with AI-based identification and object detection also enhances safety by identifying overtaking maneuvers.

These sensors collectively empower users to assess cycle path quality, monitor environmental conditions, and enhance safety during biking activities. In addition to its sensor capabilities, the senseBox:bike features intuitive design elements such as WiFi connectivity for seamless smartphone integration, enabling users to access and manage collected data effortlessly. An integrated LED display offers real-time feedback on battery status and system information, which ensures optimal functionality and user convenience. With its robust hardware configuration and advanced sensor capabilities, the senseBox:bike serves as a transformative tool for advancing research in urban mobility and facilitating data-driven decision-making in city planning initiatives.
