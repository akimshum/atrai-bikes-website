The Atrai bikes project utilizes the senseBox:bike, an advanced open-source technology developed by the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of MÃ¼nster and re:edu. Powered by the ESP32S2 microcontroller, it offers WiFi for data transmission, an SD card slot for storage, and a companion app for data privacy control.

The senseBox:bike is equipped with various sensors to capture environmental data, cycling infrastructure details, and safety metrics. These include the HDC1080 for temperature and humidity, the Sensirion SPS30 for fine dust pollution, the MPU6050 for vibration, and a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor with AI for object detection.

These sensors help assess cycle path quality, monitor environmental conditions, and enhance biking safety. The device also features WiFi connectivity for smartphone integration and an LED display for real-time feedback on battery and system status. The senseBox:bike is a powerful tool for urban mobility research and data-driven city planning.
