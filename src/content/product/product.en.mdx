    The Atrai Bike project is composed by three main technologies: the open-source hardware senseBox:bike, the mobile app and the GeoAI platform. These technologies connect the data collection and citizen participation to the analysis, overview accessible and decision making.

    On the first part, the open-source hardware senseBox:bike is powered by the ESP32S2 microcontroller and sensors to capture environmental data, cycling infrastructure details, and safety metrics. These include the HDC1080 for temperature and humidity, the Sensirion SPS30 for fine dust pollution, the MPU6050 for vibration, and a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor with AI for object detection.

    The VL53L8CX multizone ToF sensor detects passing traffic by measuring distances across 8x8 zones, identifying vehicles or cyclists up to 200 cm away under daylight, enough to flag cars breaching the 150 cm safety margin. It processes distance data using AI, achieving 96% accuracy in detecting overtaking maneuvers with efficient performance at a 10 Hz sampling rate.

    The MPU6050 sensor uses acceleration and gyroscope data to classify road surfaces into four types (asphalt, compacted, paving, and sett) and a "standing" class to filter stationary data. Processed at 10 Hz over 3 seconds, features like spectral power and RMS are fed into an AI model, achieving 79.21% accuracy overall, with 100% for "sett" and "standing" surfaces.

    While using the senseBox:bike, citizens can view live data in their app, allowing them to track their route and urban environment in real-time. After the ride, they can interact with the collected data, exploring the route and information about the surrounding area on a map.

    Once the ride is complete, the data is stored on the open data platform opensenseMap. Soon, it will be analyzed and visualized on a Data Urban platform designed to support decision-making. This will help governments and companies optimize logistics, improve bike lane infrastructure, and gain insights into cyclist flow within cities.
