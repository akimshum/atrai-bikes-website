        Weizenbaum Conference
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The re:edu team, represented by Paula Scharf and Thomas Bartoschek, featured the presentation "Sustainability^2: Energy-efficient Intelligent Bicycle Sensors to Promote Mobility Transition," at the Weizenbaum Conference on June 17, 2024. The session highlighted how energy-efficient, intelligent bicycle sensors included in the open-source senseBox:bike technology, can play a key role in promoting sustainable urban mobility.
      The discussion was the integration of AI in small, energy-efficient devices, such as bicycle sensors, represents a significant shift in how urban mobility data is collected and utilized. By improving the quality of real-time data without relying on large-scale databases and complex analytics, this innovative approach offers a more efficient and accessible alternative to traditional big data methods.

        São Paulo Workshop
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
    The first workshop focused on interactive testing of the senseBox:bike technology took place in August 2024 in São Paulo, hosted by Tem Bici—a Latin American bike-sharing company—and organized by Instituto Cordial and re:edu. Over two days, participants explored the potential of the technology for urban mobility data collection. The workshop began with a presentation and hands-on session where participants assembled the senseBox:bike and tested it during a group ride through the Faria Lima neighborhood. 
    
    On the second day, feedback and suggestions were gathered about the data collected, as well as the user experience of the app and device.
    Following the workshop, participants continued testing the technology in various infrastructure conditions across São Paulo, contributing valuable insights. The event emphasized the significance of collecting detailed cycling data—such as overtaking distances and road surface quality—to support safer infrastructure planning. 
    
    This collaborative effort strengthened the connection between citizens and the project, reinforcing the role of co-creation in developing urban mobility technologies.

        Münster workshop
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
The second workshop, held in Münster in October 2024, with a similar agenda as the Brazillian session however focused on the German bike infrastructure and urban data context. Twenty participants from bicycle organizations assembled, tested, and used the devices, sharing valuable feedback during discussions. The event began with a presentation and hands-on session where participants assembled the senseBox:bike and tested it during a group cycling round. This practical activity allowed participants to experience the technology and evaluate its performance in German urban cycling conditions. 

In the following part, a feedback round evaluated the app's usability, the accuracy of collected data, and the overall user experience. Insights from this session, combined with those from São Paulo, are fundamental in refining the system to better suit diverse urban settings. Ultimately, both workshops reinforce the value of citizen participation in co-developing urban mobility tools.
