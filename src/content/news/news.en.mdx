### Workshops 2024/25

The Atrai Bikes project's innovation journey features four workshops: two in Germany and two in Brazil. The initial UX Workshops will be held in São Paulo in August and Münster in October 2024, focusing on improving the user experience and usability of the senseBox:bike. Following in 2025, Data Workshops in the same locations will delve into data analysis.

In the UX Workshops, participants will learn to use the senseBox:bike for data collection, ensuring accuracy and identifying areas for improvement, adapting the hardware to fit local contexts. In the project’s second year, Data Workshops will analyze collected data and leveraging the GeoAI tool, participants will discuss potential applications, implications and audiences.

Through these collaborative meetings, the project aims to foster dialogue, drive innovation, and improve urban cycling environments. Additionally, it serves as a platform for evaluation, initiating data collection, and raising awareness among citizens and city stakeholders about the project's technology and objectives.
